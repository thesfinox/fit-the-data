# Description

This code is a simple data analysis written in *Wolfram Mathematica*.
It provides basic codes for linear and parabolic fit of data and a gaussian 
analysis of occurences. The code should be adapted to one's specific needs,
as it includes the creation of output in different directories. It was first
written and intended for a Windows machine, but can be adapted to Linux 
systems. They were written in Italian, but I can provide an English version
of them.

# Code

These Wolfram Mathematica notebooks are structured in distinct sections:
* Data input:
    * important names are firstly set
    * input files are required for data manipulation
* First analysis:
    * notable parameters (chi squared, etc.) are calculated 
    * data is plotted and saved
* Second analysis:
    * given previous parameters, a more refined calculation is performed
    * data is plotted and saved in different position
* Third analysis:
    * if needed, errors and distributions are determined *a posteriori*

# Motivation

We decided to write this code during the university course of *Nuclear 
Physics and Laboratory* in order to speed the analysis up and to provide
reliable data to store, during the experiments.

# Contributors

Contributors are welcome to improve and criticize (keeping in mind that 
we are not software developers and the purpose of this code was merely to 
save us a lot of work: it was firstly intended to meet our particular needs 
in that specific situation, *see _MOTIVATION_*) any of the content here 
provided.
